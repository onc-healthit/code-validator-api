This project does vocabulary validation of C-CDAs against a configured repository of codesystem and valueset files.

The following environment properties are expected:

1. vocabulary.localCodeRepositoryDir - this is the path to the codesystems (SMOMED-CT, LOINC, ETC.)
2. vocabulary.localValueSetRepositoryDir - this is the path to the valuesets. Valuesets MUST be .xlsx files.
3. referenceccda.configFile - this is the path to the validator configuration. This configuration consists of xpath expressions to
   target elements in a given C-CDA and the validators used to validate the section. A working configuration file can be found
   in the project referenced at the bottom of this readme.

Also, please see the CodeValidatorApiConfiguration class to get more details on how these environment properties are used.


See https://github.com/siteadmin/referenceccdavalidator for an example implementation and instructions.

See https://github.com/mieweb/vagrant-ccda-validator for a vagrant up quick start to start validating in no time.
